## About me
My name is Tai and I'm currently a 3rd year student at UC San Diego majoring in Cognitive Science: Machine Learning & Neural Computation. I like working with technologies and learning about their impact in the evolution of society. My hobbies include hiking, swimming, and going to the theater (with friends ~~or alone~~)!

## Experience
I'm currently trying to gain as much experience as I can through projects, courseworks, and collaboration outside of school. 

## Projects
Here are some of the small projects that I worked on in the past to familiarize myself with various technologies:
- [Employee Management App](https://github.com/tnl001/employee_management) 
- [Priority Waitlist App](https://github.com/tnl001/PriorityWaitlist)
- [Park & Crime Analysis](https://github.com/tnl001/cogs108/tree/master/final_project)

## Favorite programming languages/technologies
1. C++ (idk why but `std::cout` is so satisfying to type!)
2. Python
3. Java

I'm also currently **learning** and messing around with ASP.NET and I think it's pretty fun!

## Other technologies
These are **_self-taught_**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React
- SQL

## Todo this quarter
- [] Stay on top of classes
- [] Make *more* friends
- [] Nail coding interviews

## Miscellaneous
The most **scary** saying (in my opinion) while studying computer science at UC San Diego:
> Start early, start often
